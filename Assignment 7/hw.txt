Yes.
Becasue the private key is on teammate's compter, and they don't have access to those private key, 
and those original files have been encrypted by public key, and
all the tranfering data are garbled, the data is safe.



1)No
other people would be able to access the private key during authentication session,
So it is not safe the private key have been compromised. As a result, they can access to our private key and decrypter.
The data is not safe.

2)No
Not safe, because other team can have access to our system files, 
which including the ssh folders which contain all kind of keys including private and public keys.
As a result, they can not only decrypt our message, but send our fake file or data.
The data is not safe.

This command will check whether or not the public key and signatures match or not.
While the file is tranfering, it can be intercept by other's, and other people going
can exchange the signatures( intercept guy's public key and a key will be trigged by this public key), and send it to receiver.
gpg --verify will decrypt those files with some bad function. Which could cause damge to the files.

solution is the built a trust third party company to deal with file transfer.
